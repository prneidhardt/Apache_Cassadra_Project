# Data-Modeling
Sparkify Project

- Project completed as part of Udacity's Data Engineering with AWS Nanodegree Program
- Project delivered in May 2023
- Repository includes three files:
  - Jupyter notebook with Python code
  - CSV file resulting from pre-processing pipeline
  - Image denormalized table in final CSV file

## Problem Statement
- A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

- They'd like a data engineer to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions. You'll be able to test your database by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify to create the results.

## Skills and Tools
- Data preprocessing
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
- Apache Cassandra
- Data modeling
